### Project Solution:
_Include a comprehensive summary of all important information about your project solution here._
A variational circuit algorithm is used to fit the sine graph given a small number of samples due to the trigonometric nature of the RX gate. We also explore an alternative, advanced method of fitting the sine graph by solving a differential equation.

The solution for the weld problem is to implement a customizable Keras quanvolutional network, augmented with Nvidia cuQuantum GPU acceleration to implement a quanvolutional neural network.
The quanvolutional neural network convolves the image with a size $K$ square kernel to produce $L$ channels, while downscaling the image by a factor of $K$.
The circuit associated with the quanvolutional network (the "quanvolutional circuit") is adjustable and can create families of quantum circuits that vary in the number of inputs (subject to a determinate state preparation) followed by random gates.
Each pixel convoluted is converted into the measurements of a quanvolutional circuit run.
